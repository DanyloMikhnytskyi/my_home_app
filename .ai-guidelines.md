AI Agent Guidelines

Rule 1 (enforced): Never produce `export default` in code. Use named exports only:

export const Foo = ...
export function bar() { ... }

How enforcement works in this repo:

- ESLint rule `import/no-default-export` is enabled and set to `error`.
- A Git pre-commit hook blocks commits that stage files containing `export default`.
- CI should run `npm run lint` to catch any remaining violations.

If you are an automated agent editing this repo, follow this guideline and run the project's linter before committing.
